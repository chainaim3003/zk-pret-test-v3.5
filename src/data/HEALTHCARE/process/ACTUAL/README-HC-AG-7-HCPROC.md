`C:\SATHYA\CHAINAIM3003\mcp-servers\35pret\35pretclone2\zk-pret-test-v3.5\src\data\HEALTHCARE\process\ACTUAL`

## ACCEPTED VARIANTS (2 Files)

### 1. HC-AG-7-HCPROC-Accepted-1.bpmn
**Pattern**: `abcdfgjkmnp` (Standard automation path)
- **Scenario**: Perfect execution with standard automation
- **Flow**: Clinical demand → Inventory check → Contract validation → Automated pricing → EDI standardization → Standard fulfillment → Compliance sync → Standard compliance → Logistics → Auto approval → Completion
- **Probability**: ~45% of real-world cases
- **Key Features**: 
  - Follows expected regex pattern perfectly
  - All mandatory convergence points maintained
  - Proper multi-entity coordination
  - Standard automated approval

### 2. HC-AG-7-HCPROC-Accepted-2.bpmn  
**Pattern**: `abcefhjlmop` (Complex manual path)
- **Scenario**: Manual contract resolution with maximum complexity
- **Flow**: Clinical demand → Inventory check → Contract validation → Manual resolution → EDI standardization → Exception handling → Compliance sync → Cold chain compliance → Logistics → Executive approval → Completion
- **Probability**: ~3% of real-world cases
- **Key Features**:
  - Follows expected regex pattern with all exception paths
  - Includes human intervention (UserTasks)
  - Cold chain compliance requirements
  - Executive approval required
  - Demonstrates maximum multi-entity coordination

## REJECTED VARIANTS (2 Files)

### 3. HC-AG-7-HCPROC-Rejected-1.bpmn
**Pattern**: `abcdgjkmnp` (INVALID - skips EDI standardization)
- **Critical Error**: Skips mandatory EDI standardization step
- **Flow**: Contract validation → **DIRECTLY** to supplier inventory (bypasses GHX routing)
- **Violation**: Missing Task_6 (EDI Transaction Routing Agent)
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Red highlighting on invalid flow edge
  - Missing convergence point
  - Process would fail in real world
- **Business Impact**: Supplier systems cannot process non-standard format
- **Severity**: Critical - Order failure, patient safety risk

### 4. HC-AG-7-HCPROC-Rejected-2.bpmn
**Pattern**: `abcdfgjmnp` (INVALID - bypasses compliance)  
- **Criminal Violation**: Completely skips regulatory compliance verification
- **Flow**: Supplier allocation → **DIRECTLY** to logistics (bypasses compliance sync)
- **Violation**: Missing Gateway_9 and all compliance tasks
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Red highlighting on compliance bypass flow
  - Missing FDA/DEA/DSCSA validation
  - No multi-entity compliance synchronization
- **Business Impact**: Federal regulatory violations, potential criminal charges
- **Severity**: Criminal - FDA/DEA violations, controlled substance violations

## Visual Elements for bpmn.io

All files include complete visual elements:
- **Service Tasks**: Rectangular shapes for AI agents
- **User Tasks**: Rounded rectangles for human intervention
- **Parallel Gateways**: Diamond shapes for multi-entity coordination
- **Start/End Events**: Circular shapes
- **Sequence Flows**: Labeled arrows with regex pattern letters
- **Coordinates**: Proper positioning for clear visualization
- **Error Highlighting**: Red borders/fills for rejected variants

## Key Differences Between Accepted vs Rejected

**Accepted Variants**:
- ✅ Maintain all mandatory convergence points
- ✅ Follow valid regex patterns
- ✅ Include proper multi-entity synchronization
- ✅ Respect healthcare regulatory requirements
- ✅ Can be executed in real healthcare systems

**Rejected Variants**:
- ❌ Skip critical process steps
- ❌ Break multi-entity coordination
- ❌ Violate healthcare compliance requirements
- ❌ Would cause system failures or legal violations
- ❌ Visual error indicators (red highlighting)

## Testing Integration

These files are ready for integration with the existing test framework:
- Compatible with `BusinessProcessIntegrityOptimMerkleVerificationFileTestWithSign.js`
- Follow same naming convention as HC-AG-1-ECLNTL examples
- Include proper BPMN 2.0 XML structure for validation
- Can be imported directly into bpmn.io for visualization

## Usage Instructions

1. **Import into bpmn.io**: All files can be directly imported and will display properly
2. **Testing**: Use with existing test scripts to validate process integrity
3. **Comparison**: Compare accepted vs rejected variants to understand compliance requirements
4. **Training**: Use as examples for healthcare procurement process modeling

Each file represents a realistic healthcare procurement scenario with proper multi-entity agent coordination and authentic regulatory compliance requirements.
