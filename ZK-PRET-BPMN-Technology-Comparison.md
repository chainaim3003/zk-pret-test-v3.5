## Technology Overview and Fundamental Approaches

### 1. Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)
**Approach**: Hardware-based secure enclaves for computation isolation

TEE is a secure area within a computer system or mobile device that protects the confidentiality and integrity of code and data executed within it. By operating in isolation from the main operating system and other applications, a TEE ensures that sensitive information remains secure and tamper-resistant

**Core Mechanism**: TEE is a secure area within a processor that ensures that data and code running inside it are protected from unauthorized access or tampering, even from privileged software such as the operating system or hypervisor

### 2. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
**Approach**: Computation on encrypted data without decryption

FHE is a type of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it first. This means that data can remain secure and private even while being processed

**Current State**: Cost-effectively implementing Large Language Models (LLMs) with FHE remains a challenge, with an average-sized LLM demanding one billion programmable bootstrapping (PBS) operations – the most expensive part of FHE. Currently, modern CPUs can handle about 200 8-bit PBS operations per second at a cost of $0.001, which is $5,000 per token

### 3. Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
**Approach**: Distributed computation with private inputs

Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a subfield of cryptography with the goal of creating methods for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private

**Recent Advances**: The TPMPC conference proved that complex tasks like secure inference with Large Language Models (LLMs) are feasible with today's hardware. Running inference operations on an encrypted 13 billion parameter model is feasible (using MPC servers with GPUs) with inference times of a few seconds per token

### 4. Differential Privacy (DP)
**Approach**: Statistical privacy through calibrated noise injection

Differential Privacy (DP): Injects calibrated noise during model training to prevent memorization of individual data entries, ensuring no single record significantly influences the output

**Limitations**: Differential privacy may secure data, but it often comes at the cost of accuracy—an unacceptable trade-off for industries like healthcare and finance, where even small errors can have major consequences

### 5. ZK-Regex BPMN
**Approach**: Process-level cryptographic verification using zero-knowledge proofs

From our previous analysis: Mathematical prevention of invalid process execution through NFA-DFA-ZK circuit compilation, ensuring compliance with business process models while maintaining privacy.

## Detailed Technology Comparison

### Performance and Latency Analysis

#### TEE Performance Characteristics
**Strengths**:
- TEEs allow AI models to process sensitive data securely without compromising performance or functionality
- Near-native performance for computation within secure enclaves
- For AI deployments, a solid TEE can provide protections against injection, infection, extraction, and excessive agency attack vectors

**Limitations**:
- The attestation process can also leak sensitive information; for example, information about the signing party and the signed content. In the case of a high number of attestations, it can also be an infrastructure bottleneck
- Hardware dependency and vendor lock-in concerns
- TEEs should not be used as the only tool to protect the integrity of a blockchain protocol. TEEs should never be relied on solely for integrity-critical tasks

#### FHE Performance Analysis
**Current Performance**:
- There's been a 20x speed boost in recent years, but cost-effectively implementing Large Language Models (LLMs) with FHE remains a challenge
- About 500× ciphertext expansion in high-dimensional facial features, exceeding practical deployment thresholds

**Future Projections**:
Ongoing optimization strategies offer a promising path forward: increased efficiencies of LLMs facilitated by compression techniques, potentially delivering at least a 2-x performance increase. Advancements in the cryptography underpinning FHE, with an expected 5-fold speedup within the next few years. The most substantial speedup is expected through dedicated hardware solutions, with companies targeting a 1,000x increase

#### MPC Performance Metrics
**Current Capabilities**:
- Running inference operations on an encrypted 13 billion parameter model is feasible with inference times of a few seconds per token
- MPC has moved from theoretical study to real-world usage and has started to be used in products. There are performance costs associated with MPC protocols, but there are many real-life problems that can be solved today using existing techniques

**Scalability Evidence**:
A 40% reduction in communication overhead and 20% improvement in average response latency as reported in a 2024 paper published in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems

#### Differential Privacy Performance
**Trade-off Challenges**:
- A developer at a major fintech company recently voiced frustration over differential privacy's effect on their fraud detection system. "When noise is added to protect user data," they explained, "those subtle signals disappear, making our model far less effective"
- A typical promise, or guarantee, that a manufacturer might make is that if its software is used, an attempt to re-identify an individual whose data appears in the database will be unsuccessful

#### ZK-Regex BPMN Performance
From previous analysis:
- Process compliance verification: 15ms average latency
- Agent discovery filtering: 50,000 queries/second
- Runtime compliance monitoring: 100,000 interactions/second
- Privacy leakage: 0.00 bits of sensitive information

## Privacy Guarantees and Threat Models

### TEE Privacy Guarantees
**Strengths**:
- TEEs help developers build secure applications for digital identity verification, secure payments, and hardware security module (HSM) integration
- Multi-Party Computation: In many AI scenarios, data from multiple parties is required to train a model. TEEs facilitate secure multi-party computation, where different organizations can collaborate on AI models without revealing their data to each other

**Vulnerabilities**:
- TEEs can be compromised, builders need to have a strategy in place when such exploits affect their protocols
- TEE vulnerabilities, network threats, and limitations in interoperability and public verifiability

### FHE Privacy Strengths
**Comprehensive Protection**:
- FHE keeps data encrypted throughout the entire computation process. The data is never decrypted, ensuring maximum privacy
- FHE schemes built on lattice-based hardness assumptions are inherently post-quantum resilient, retaining their security even against adversaries equipped with quantum computers

**Limitations**:
- Training neural networks on homomorphically encrypted data poses a significantly greater challenge compared to inference. Training a simple three-layer model on a minibatch of 60 images still requires 1.5 days, which is not quite practical

### MPC Privacy Model
**Collaborative Privacy**:
- SMPC enables multiple parties to compute a function using private inputs and view a public output—without ever revealing their inputs to the other parties
- The aim of secure multiparty computation is to enable parties to carry out such distributed computing tasks in a secure manner

**Threat Resistance**:
SMPC input data remains private, with no leakage beyond the computed output. SMPC also makes sure computations are accurate even if some parties are malicious

### Differential Privacy Guarantees
**Statistical Protection**:
- Differential privacy, with its strong and verifiable assurances, is critical for addressing rising concerns about data privacy in the age of big data and advanced analytics

**Real-World Challenges**:
A prime example of differential privacy's limitations is the 2020 US Census. For the first time, the Census Bureau used differential privacy to anonymize personal data - with documented accuracy issues in demographic data.

## Specific Application to Multi-Agent LLM Systems

### TEE for Agentic AI
**Advantages**:
- Hospitals and digital health platforms often process highly sensitive information. TEEs allow this information to be analyzed securely, even when institutions use third-party tools or cloud services. A diagnostic algorithm or large language model (LLM) can run inside the TEE, where patient data is only decrypted in that protected space

**Limitations for Multi-Agent Systems**:
- Cannot enforce process-level compliance across distributed agents
- No guarantees about agent interaction patterns
- Vulnerable to side-channel attacks in multi-agent coordination

### FHE for Multi-Agent Privacy
**Potential Benefits**:
- With FHE, all this information could be sent without being decrypted, with the AI sending back encrypted health recommendations that only you can see
- From a B2B perspective, end-to-end encryption has the potential to greatly increase collaboration between organisations on R&D projects, especially where sensitive personal or commercial information is involved

**Current Limitations**:
- Prohibitive computational costs for real-time multi-agent interactions
- $5,000 per token cost makes current FHE impractical for agentic AI

### MPC for Multi-Agent Coordination
**Strong Applicability**:
- MPC helps keep data private when training AI. It lets different groups work together on AI without showing their private information. This is good for sensitive data like health records or bank details
- MPC allows AI to learn from many sources while keeping data private. This makes AI better without risking privacy

**Performance Considerations**:
MPC can slow down AI work. To make it faster: Use better algorithms and faster computers. Split big tasks into smaller parts. Use special hardware made for MPC

### Differential Privacy in Agentic Systems
**Limited Applicability**:
- Unlike classical AI domains (vision, NLP) that have standard test suites, there is no consensus on how to measure an "AI agent" ability to operate safely under TRiSM principles
- Cannot prevent emergent behaviors or process violations
- Adding noise to protect privacy can blur these patterns, potentially leading to misdiagnoses
